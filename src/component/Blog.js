           <p>The mango is an irregular, egg-shaped fruit which is a fleshy drupe.
            [4] Mangos are typically 8–12 centimetres (3–5 inches) long and greenish yellow in color.
             The fruits can be round, oval, heart, or kidney shaped.[4] Mango fruits are green when they are unripe.[4]
              The interior flesh is bright orange and soft with a large, flat pit in the middle.[4] 
              Mangos are mature in April and May. Raw mangos can be used in the making of pickles and chutneys.
              [11] Ripe mangos are a popular fruit throughout the world. The skin and pulp account for 85% of the mango's weight,
               and the remaining 15% comes from the stone (seed).[12]</p>
